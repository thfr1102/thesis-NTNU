abstract = {Understanding the level of security awareness, the perception, and the culture of users in aspects related to security, is crucial for the development of suitable measures towards their protection and the protection of the utilized infrastructure. This becomes imperative in countries with increased penetration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as Norway. In this paper, we present the results of a study conducted by NTNU and Eidsiva bredbånd AS, in respect to the security awareness and cyber security culture of Norwegian users of ICT. The study aims to investigate the level of security awareness of Norwegian Internet subscription owners and identify how and if their security awareness can be improved. For that reason, we aim to identify the demographic groups and the characteristics of the security awareness of the Internet users. These attributes have been used to identify the need for knowledge and the cyber security training preferences among different groups of internet users. We have discovered that the level of security awareness is highly subjective and that training programs provided by Internet Service Providers are recommendable.},

abstract = "In recent years, rapid progress in the use of the internet has resulted in huge losses in many organizations due to lax security. As a result, information security awareness is becoming an important issue to anyone using the Internet. To reduce losses, organizations have made information security awareness a top priority. The three main barriers to information security awareness are: (1) general security awareness, (2) employees’ computer skills, and (3) organizational budgets. Online learning appears a feasible alternative to providing information security awareness and countering these three barriers. Research has identified three levels of security awareness: perception, comprehension and projection. This paper reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates the impacts of hypermedia, multimedia and hypertext to increase information security awareness among the three awareness levels in an online training environment. The results indicate that: (1) learners who have the better understanding at the perception and comprehension levels can improve understanding at the projection level; (2) learners with text material perform better at the perception level; and (3) learners with multimedia material perform better at the comprehension level and projection level. The results could be used by educators and training designers to create meaningful information security awareness materials."

\chapter*{Abstract}
A smart home may be a relatively new concept for many people. Under ideal circumstances, interactions between users and smart home devices should be done securely, or at least with some level of risk understanding. However, security awareness may not have matured in most people yet. Therefore, this thesis will seek to identify the current security awareness level of smart home users in Norway, as well as analysing their risk perceptions, to help professionals create efficient awareness training programs. These objectives include the identification of usage patterns, user motivations and routines which may impose risk amplification in their daily lives. To achieve the desired results, I will utilise a quantitative methodology to create an index with multiple indicators to assess the security awareness levels of smart home users in Norway.
